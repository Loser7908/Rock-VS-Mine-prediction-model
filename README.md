# Rock vs. Mine Prediction

**## Overview**

This project is focused on using machine learning, specifically logistic regression, to predict whether an underwater object is a "rock" or a "mine" based on sonar signal data. It is a classic binary classification problem.

**## Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the "Sonar Dataset" (also known as the Mines vs. Rocks dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains sonar signal data features along with labels indicating whether the object is a "rock" or a "mine."

**## Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided notebooks)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
**Navigate to the project directory:**


cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
Install the required Python libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**
You can use this project as a template for binary classification tasks or as a reference for building and evaluating logistic regression models.

**Training the Model**
To train the logistic regression model:

Prepare your dataset by replacing sonar_data.csv with your data file or by modifying the existing data.
Run the Jupyter Notebook train_logistic_regression.ipynb to train the model.
Adjust hyperparameters and preprocessing steps as needed.
**Evaluation**
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Results**
The results of the rock vs. mine prediction, including evaluation metrics and visualizations, can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook (train_logistic_regression.ipynb).

**Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! Please fork this repository and create a pull request with your suggested changes or improvements.
